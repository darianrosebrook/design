# Designer Project - Gaps, Ambiguities & Research Questions

**Author**: @darianrosebrook  
**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Research Required  
**Risk**: High - These gaps must be resolved before implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This document identifies critical gaps, ambiguities, and unknowns in the Designer project specification that require detailed research, prototyping, or architectural decisions before implementation can proceed safely.

**Priority Levels:**
- ðŸ”´ **P0 (Blocking)**: Must resolve before any implementation
- ðŸŸ  **P1 (Critical)**: Must resolve before feature completion
- ðŸŸ¡ **P2 (Important)**: Should resolve during implementation
- ðŸ”µ **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Can defer to future iterations

---

## 1. Deterministic Code Generation ðŸ”´ P0

### Gap: Specific Implementation of Determinism Guarantees

**What We Know:**
- Code generation must be deterministic (same input â†’ identical output)
- No `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, unstable ordering allowed
- SHA-256 hash comparison for validation

**What We Don't Know:**
1. **Clock Injection Pattern**:
   - How exactly do we inject a deterministic clock into the codegen system?
   - What interface does the clock provide?
   - How do we test it's being used correctly?

2. **String Ordering Guarantees**:
   - JavaScript object iteration order is insertion-order, but what about:
     - Webpack/esbuild module ordering?
     - Import statement ordering?
     - CSS property ordering?
   - Do we need a canonical sorter for all output strings?

3. **Floating Point Precision**:
   - Design coordinates can be floats (x: 12.5, y: 34.7)
   - Different machines might handle float operations differently
   - What precision do we enforce? (e.g., `.toFixed(2)`)
   - How do we handle rounding at boundaries?

4. **Template Rendering**:
   - Are templates pure functions or do they have state?
   - How do we ensure template helpers are deterministic?
   - Can templates depend on filesystem state (e.g., checking if file exists)?

### Research Questions
