# Archived Canvas Specifications

**Author**: @darianrosebrook  
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Consolidated into DESIGNER-022

## Overview

The following canvas-related specifications have been archived and consolidated into a single comprehensive refactor specification:

### Archived Specifications

- **DESIGNER-002-canvas-schema.yaml** - Canvas Schema & Validation System
- **DESIGNER-003-canvas-engine.yaml** - Canvas Engine - Scene Graph Operations
- **DESIGNER-005-canvas-renderer.yaml** - Canvas Renderer - DOM/2D Rendering Engine
- **DESIGNER-007-vscode-ext.yaml** - VS Code Extension - Designer Webview Host
- **DESIGNER-013-properties-panel.yaml** - Properties Panel - Interactive Property Editing
- **DESIGNER-016-canvas-webview-host.yaml** - Canvas Webview Host Integration
- **DESIGNER-018-renderer-interaction-layer.yaml** - Renderer Coordinate System & Interaction Layer
- **DESIGNER-022-canvas-refactor.yaml** - Designer Canvas Engine - Complete Testing Suite Implementation

### Consolidation Rationale

The original approach of separating canvas functionality across multiple specifications led to:

1. **Architectural Fragmentation** - Components developed in isolation without unified coordination
2. **Integration Issues** - Coordinate system inconsistencies between renderer and interaction layers
3. **Performance Problems** - Memory leaks and rendering performance issues from improper cleanup
4. **Bundle Complexity** - Multiple separate build processes and webview contexts
5. **Implementation Gaps** - Critical functionality missing due to scope boundaries

### New Unified Approach: DESIGNER-022

**DESIGNER-022-canvas-refactor.yaml** consolidates all canvas functionality into a single, cohesive architecture:

#### Key Architectural Changes

1. **Unified Canvas Host** - Single webview containing renderer, properties panel, and interaction layers
2. **Integrated State Management** - Shared state store between canvas and inspector components
3. **Simplified Coordinate System** - Document-space positioning with proper HiDPI handling
4. **Consolidated Bundle** - Single build process for webview with deterministic output
5. **Unified Message Protocol** - Single message bus with comprehensive validation

#### Benefits of Consolidation

- **Reduced Complexity** - Single specification to maintain and implement
- **Better Integration** - Components designed to work together from the start
- **Improved Performance** - Optimized rendering pipeline with proper dirty tracking
- **Enhanced Reliability** - Comprehensive error handling and rollback strategies
- **Simplified Testing** - Single test suite covering entire canvas functionality

#### Implementation Priority

DESIGNER-022 is marked as **Risk Tier 1** with a **30-minute rollback SLO**, indicating this is a critical refactor that will form the foundation for all future canvas functionality.

### Migration Notes

- All acceptance criteria from archived specs are preserved in DESIGNER-022
- Performance requirements consolidated into unified metrics
- Security requirements strengthened with comprehensive validation
- Observability requirements expanded for better debugging

### Next Steps

1. Implement DESIGNER-022 unified canvas architecture
2. Migrate existing canvas code to new architecture
3. Update documentation and examples
4. Remove archived specifications after successful implementation
