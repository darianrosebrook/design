threats:
  - 'Properties panel becomes unresponsive with complex selections'
  - 'Property changes not properly synchronized with canvas'
  - 'Memory leaks from retained property editors'
  - 'Inconsistent property display across node types'
  - 'Accessibility issues with property controls'

invariants:
  - 'Property panel only shows properties applicable to selected node types'
  - 'All property changes immediately reflected in canvas rendering'
  - 'Property values validated before application'
  - 'Panel handles mixed selections gracefully'
  - 'Progressive disclosure keeps interface uncluttered'
acceptance:
  - id: A1
    given: 'Single node selected in canvas'
    when: 'Properties panel opens'
    then: 'Shows only properties applicable to that node type'
  - id: A2
    given: 'User changes property value'
    when: 'Value is applied'
    then: 'Canvas updates immediately and property panel reflects new value'
  - id: A3
    given: 'Multiple nodes selected with different properties'
    when: 'Properties panel displays'
    then: 'Shows mixed values appropriately and handles batch updates'
  - id: A4
    given: 'Text node selected'
    when: 'Typography section expands'
    then: 'Shows font family, size, weight, line height, letter spacing controls'
  - id: A5
    given: 'Frame node selected'
    when: 'Layout section shows'
    then: 'Displays position, size, rotation, alignment, and constraint controls'
  - id: A6
    given: 'Complex selection (10+ nodes)'
    when: 'Properties panel renders'
    then: 'Maintains responsive performance without blocking UI'
non_functional:
  a11y:
    - 'All property controls keyboard accessible'
    - 'Screen reader announces property changes'
    - 'High contrast mode supported'
    - 'Focus management between canvas and panel'
  perf:
    panel_render_ms: 100
    property_sync_ms: 50
    additional:
      - 'Panel handles 100+ properties without performance degradation'
      - 'Property changes sync within 50ms of canvas updates'
      - 'Memory usage <20MB for typical usage'
  security:
    - 'Property values sanitized before display'
    - 'No arbitrary code execution from property data'
    - 'Panel respects workspace file boundaries'
