# Working Style & Risk Limits

## Intent
Prefer directly applying fixes over explaining. Explanations are secondary unless asked, or when a change is **risky** (see Risk Gate).

## Edit Principles
- **Small, bounded diffs.** Keep edits minimal, cohesive, and reviewable.
- **Edit existing modules over forking.** Prefer refactor + rename to duplication.
- **Preserve public behavior** unless the task explicitly requests behavioral change.

## Ask-First Triggers (Risk Gate)
Before editing, *ask with a Targeted Edit Plan* if any are true:
- Changes cross package boundaries or public APIs.
- Requires deleting files or renaming public symbols.
- Introduces a new dependency or build tool.
- Affects security, persistence, auth, or infra.
- Touches > 10 files or > 300 LOC.

**Targeted Edit Plan (TEP)** must include:
- Scope (files, symbols), risks, rollback notes.
- Tests to run/update.
- Acceptance checks (what passing looks like).

## Diff Hygiene
- Keep each commit focused on one intent.
- Include brief rationale in the commit subject (â‰¤72 chars).
- Never bypass pre-commit hooks; `--no-verify` is **forbidden**.

## When to Explain
- On TEP prompts, on rejected edits, or when trade-offs are non-obvious.
- Keep explanations concise and adjacent to the diff.

## Acceptance (per PR)
- Tests + lints pass locally.
- No widened public API surface without TEP.
- No dead code or duplicate modules introduced.
