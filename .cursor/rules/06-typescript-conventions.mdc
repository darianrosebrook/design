# TS/JS Conventions

## Variables
- Prefer `const` over `let` where possible.

## Imports
- Use aliased imports from `@/` (mapped to `src`).
- Replace deep relative paths (`../../x`) with `@/...` when available.

## Types
- Single source of truth at `src/types`.
- Before creating a new type, check and extend the canonical definition.
- Avoid duplicate declarations; prefer composition or augmentation.

## Modularity
- As files approach ~1000 LOC, evaluate separation of concerns; extract cohesive units.

## Acceptance
- No unnecessary `let`.
- No duplicate type declarations.
- No deep relative paths where alias exists.
