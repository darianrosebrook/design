# Quality Gates

## Execution
- Run unit tests and lints after any major change; iterate until green.
- If the project defines an engine, confirm Node version via console before running scripts.
- `.env` files exist; do **not** attempt to cat protected dotfiles. Use framework tooling or documented env loaders.

## Commits
- `--no-verify` is **not allowed**. If hooks fail, **fix the cause** or split work into smaller audited commits.
- Commit subjects: **what + why** in one sentence. Bodies for context only when needed.

## TODOs & Placeholders
Tag placeholders explicitly in code:
- `// TODO: ...` (critical, must block if reached)
- `// PLACEHOLDER: ...` (non-critical placeholder, warn)
- `// MOCK DATA: ...` (remove before release)

**Critical TODOs**: throw at execution site with clear message.

## Diagrams/Charts
- In Markdown, use **Mermaid** only. Ensure contrast (dark text on light, light on dark backgrounds).

## Acceptance
- `test`, `lint`, `typecheck` succeed.
- No TODOs executed at runtime.
- No style violations flagged by project linters.
