# Logging & Language

## Clarity over chronology
Remove "phase/week" phrasing in docs/logs. State the **specific improvement**:
- ❌ "PHASE 1 optimization"
- ✅ "Initialize workload analyzer for parallelization"

## Emojis
- Emojis are banned across code, docs, and commits.
- Exception (debug logs only): ⚠️, ✅, 🚫.

## Commit Tone
Professional, neutral, and specific. Avoid hype or vague framing.
