# Process Discipline

## Servers
- Before starting a dev server, check if one is already running on the port; reuse or stop it to avoid duplicates.
- If multiple processes are attached to the port, list and kill explicitly; document PIDs in the PR note if non-obvious.

## Hung/Canceled Commands
If a command is canceled or stalls:
1) Assume it hung or waited for input.
2) Re-run with verbose/debug flags.
3) Surface the prompt/interaction in the PR so reviewers understand the resolution.
