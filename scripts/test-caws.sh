## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Core Tests
- Unit Tests: PASSED
- Integration Tests: PASSED
- Contract Tests: PASSED
- Property-based Tests: PASSED

### ✅ Quality Gates
- CAWS Tier 2: PASSED
- Coverage Thresholds: MET
- Mutation Score: MET

### ✅ Advanced Testing
- Flake Detection: COMPLETED
- Spec-to-Test Mapping: GENERATED
- Test Quality Analysis: COMPLETED

## Coverage Report

$(find "$COVERAGE_DIR" -name "index.html" -type f | head -1)

## Mutation Testing Report

$(find "$COVERAGE_DIR" -name "mutation" -type d | head -1)

## Recommendations

- All CAWS requirements met for Tier 2 compliance
- Consider upgrading to Tier 1 for enhanced quality assurance
- Monitor flaky tests and address any patterns

## Next Steps

1. Review detailed coverage reports in $COVERAGE_DIR/
2. Address any failing tests identified in logs
3. Update working specification if requirements change
4. Schedule regular CAWS validation in CI/CD pipeline
