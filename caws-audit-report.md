# CAWS Audit Report - Designer Canvas Engine
**Generated:** $(date)  
**Working Spec:** DESIGNER-022  
**Risk Tier:** 2 (Core)  

## Executive Summary

This CAWS audit evaluated the Designer Canvas Engine against Tier 2 quality gates. The audit revealed critical gaps in test coverage for acceptance criteria and several quality issues requiring immediate attention.

## Audit Findings

### ✅ **Strengths**
- **TypeScript Compliance**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- **Code Quality**: Major linting violations addressed  
- **Flake Detection**: No flaky tests detected in current test suite
- **Working Spec**: Valid specification with comprehensive requirements

### ❌ **Critical Issues**

#### 1. **Acceptance Criteria Coverage: 0% (8/8 criteria uncovered)**
**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

None of the 8 acceptance criteria defined in DESIGNER-022 have corresponding tests:

- A1: Canvas transformation operations
- A2: Concurrent session conflict resolution  
- A3: React code generation from canvas documents
- A4: Design token consistency across packages
- A5: VS Code extension performance budgets
- A6: Plugin ecosystem integration
- A7: MCP server real-time broadcasting
- A8: WebSocket server performance under load

**Required Action**: Implement comprehensive integration tests covering all acceptance criteria.

#### 2. **Test Coverage Infrastructure: BROKEN**
**Risk Level: HIGH**

- Coverage provider (`@vitest/coverage-v8`) missing from dependencies
- Test execution fails preventing coverage measurement
- Unable to validate 80% branch coverage requirement for Tier 2

**Required Action**: Fix test coverage dependencies and validate coverage thresholds.

#### 3. **Test Quality Issues**
**Risk Level: MEDIUM**

Test suite exists (195 tests, 494 assertions) but has quality gaps:
- 4 files lack edge case testing
- External dependencies not properly mocked
- Missing test setup in some files

**Required Action**: Improve test isolation and add comprehensive edge case coverage.

### ⚠️ **Quality Gate Status**

| Gate | Status | Current | Required | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| **TypeScript** | ✅ PASS | 0 errors | 0 errors | All packages compile cleanly |
| **Linting** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ~300 warnings | 0 errors | Import order and `any` types remain |
| **Coverage** | ❌ FAIL | Unable to measure | ≥80% | Broken coverage infrastructure |
| **Mutation** | ❌ FAIL | Unable to measure | ≥50% | Depends on coverage |
| **Contracts** | ❓ UNKNOWN | Not validated | Required | CAWS contract validation needed |
| **Flake Detection** | ✅ PASS | 0% variance | <5% variance | No flaky tests detected |
| **Spec Mapping** | ❌ FAIL | 0/8 criteria | 8/8 criteria | No acceptance tests implemented |

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (Priority 1)**
1. **Fix Coverage Infrastructure**: Install missing `@vitest/coverage-v8` dependency
2. **Implement Acceptance Tests**: Create integration tests for all 8 acceptance criteria
3. **Validate Contracts**: Ensure API contracts match specifications

### **Short-term Actions (Priority 2)**  
4. **Address Test Quality**: Add mocking, edge cases, and proper test setup
5. **Resolve Remaining Lint Issues**: Fix import ordering and `any` types
6. **Performance Budgets**: Define concrete performance metrics in working spec

### **Long-term Actions (Priority 3)**
7. **Mutation Testing**: Implement Stryker for mutation score validation
8. **Continuous CAWS**: Integrate CAWS checks into CI/CD pipeline
9. **Test Maturity**: Expand property-based and golden master testing

## Compliance Status

**Current Tier 2 Compliance: FAILING**  
**Estimated Time to Compliance**: 2-3 weeks with focused effort

### **Blocking Issues**
- Zero acceptance criteria test coverage
- Broken test coverage measurement
- Missing contract validation

### **Non-blocking Issues**  
- Test quality improvements
- Linting refinements
- Performance budget definition

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Fix coverage infrastructure and implement 3 acceptance tests (A1, A3, A4)
2. **Week 2**: Complete remaining acceptance tests and contract validation
3. **Week 3**: Address quality improvements and performance budgets

Regular CAWS audits should be scheduled bi-weekly to track progress toward full Tier 2 compliance.
